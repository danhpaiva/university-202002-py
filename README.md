# :smile: University - Period 2020/02

## What will you find in this repository?

Here you will find some codes of the discipline: ""Distributed Systems & mobile" <br>
These are codes in <strong> .py </strong> that I made in the second half of 2020. <br>
I decided to put all these codes here as a backup. <br>
If you encounter a similar problem, maybe I will help you to reason hehehe

## About the language
All codes were made in the Portuguese language. <br>
If you can't read the language, you may not be able to understand the codes.<br>

Perhaps I will return here in the future to redo some logic. (;
